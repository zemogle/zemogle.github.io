        <h3>2017 is a momentous year. I was feeling a bit apprehensive about a particular date during this year. So much that I was really down about the whole year. I realised there was only 2 ways this could go: try to hide from it, or embrace it.</h3>
        <p>In 2017, I'm going to be 40 and I'm ok about that. I'm actually quite proud all of the great things I've done, friendships I've made, wonderful sights I've seen, and all the fun I've had since 1977.</p>

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <p>I can fully appreciate what it was like to be kid in 1980's. I understand pop culture references to 80's TV programmes and computer games. I remember Danger Mouse, Knightrider, and the A-team, before any reboots. I remember Doctor Who when
          the sets wobbled and the aliens were made from bubble wrap. I remember crazy kids TV like Count Duckula, T-Bag, Number 73, and Jamie's Magic Torch. I remember computer games that came on tapes which sang you a 7 minute song while they loaded.</p>
        <p>If you've been feeling like you want to hide away from this year and this birthday, please don't. It really won't get any easier as you get older. What we can do, is make 2017 an amazing year. We have the opportunity to celebrate at every event
          we go to and with everything we do.</p>
        <p>Let's do it.</p>
