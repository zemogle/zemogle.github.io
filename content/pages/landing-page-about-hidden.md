I am astrophysicist and an award winning educator.  As part of my role with [Las Cumbres Observatory](https://lco.global) I try to find novel ways to engage the public in science by using astronomy. This has taken the form of creating citizen science projects like [Asteroid Tracker](https://asteroidtracker.lco.global/), interactive educational web apps like [Star in a Box](https://starinabox.lco.global), and online celebrity events like [Show Me Stars](https://lco.global/news/show-me-stars/) and an award winning education programme, [Global Sky Partners](https://lco.global/education/partners). I am very proud of a science comic book series I co-wrote called [Ada's Adventures in Science](http://www.adacomic.uk), which is available in 13 languages and more than 15,000 copies have been sent to over 20 countries.
