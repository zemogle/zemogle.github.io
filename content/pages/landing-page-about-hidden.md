I am an astrophysicist and [award winning educator](https://lco.global/news/dr-edward-gomez-las-cumbres-observatory-wins-2020-lise-meitner-medal/).  As part of my role with [Las Cumbres Observatory](https://lco.global) I find novel ways to engage the public in science by using astronomy. This has taken the form of creating citizen science projects like [Asteroid Tracker](https://asteroidtracker.lco.global/), interactive educational web apps like [Star in a Box](https://starinabox.lco.global), and online celebrity events like [Show Me Stars](https://lco.global/news/show-me-stars/) and an award winning education programme, [Global Sky Partners](https://lco.global/education/partners). I love [storytelling](/bedtime/) and am very proud of a science comic book series I co-wrote called [Ada's Adventures in Science](http://www.adacomic.uk), which is available in 18 languages and more than 15,000 copies have been sent to over 20 countries. Since 2024 I have been the president of Division C (Education, Outreach and Heritage) in the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.iau.org).
