      <description>2017 was a momentous year. I was feeling a bit apprehensive about a particular date during this year. So much that I was really down about the whole year. I realised there was only 2 ways this could go: try to hide from it, or embrace it. In 2017, I turned 40 and I&amp;rsquo;m ok about that. I&amp;rsquo;m actually quite proud all of the great things I&amp;rsquo;ve done, friendships I&amp;rsquo;ve made, wonderful sights I&amp;rsquo;ve seen, and all the fun I&amp;rsquo;ve had since 1977.</description>

      <description>I carried my phone with me almost everywhere in 2017. I used Swarm (formerlly the &amp;lsquo;check in&amp;rsquo; part of Foursquare) to track the places I went. I then wrote some code to extract that from the Foursquare API and produce the map above and the lists below. All of the code is on GitHub - you can fork me!
Steps I walked 2,999,935 steps during Year Zero. That about 1872 km.</description>
